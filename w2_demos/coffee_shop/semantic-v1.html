        <p>
          Espresso is a concentrated coffee brewed by forcing hot water under pressure through finely-ground coffee beans. 
          Known for its rich aroma and bold taste, espresso serves as the base for many popular drinks. 
          It's traditionally enjoyed as a quick shot but can also be sipped slowly to appreciate the depth of its roasted flavor. 
          Despite its small size, it delivers a strong caffeine kick and a lingering crema on top.

        <h2>Cappuccino</h2>

        <p>
          Cappuccino is a classic Italian coffee drink made with equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam. 
          Its velvety texture and balanced flavor make it a staple in cafes worldwide. 
          The frothy top layer helps retain heat and adds a creamy mouthfeel. 
          Often served in smaller cups than a latte, cappuccinos offer a bold yet smooth experience, perfect for a mid-morning boost or relaxed caf√© break.

        <h2>Iced Mocha</h2>

        <p>Chocolate, espresso, milk, served over ice.</p>
        <p>
          A refreshing blend of chocolate and coffee, iced mocha is perfect for warm days. 
          It starts with a shot of espresso, mixed with milk and rich chocolate syrup, then poured over ice for a chilled treat. 
          Often topped with whipped cream, it's a sweet, energizing drink that strikes a balance between dessert and caffeine fix. 
          Its smooth texture and cooling effect make it a favorite for summer coffee lovers.
