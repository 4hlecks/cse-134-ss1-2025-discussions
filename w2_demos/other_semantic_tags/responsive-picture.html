  <h1>Responsive Images supporting Multiple Formats</h1>
  <p><code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> is useful to serve different images cropped or composed differently depending on screen size and resolution. Efficient image formats like <strong>AVIF</strong> or <strong>WebP</strong> can be used for browsers that support them and fallback to older formats like <strong>JPEG</strong> and <strong>PNG</strong> for browsers that don't.</p>
  <picture>
    <!-- Large screens: AVIF (best compression & quality but poor compatibility) if supported -->
    <source
      srcset="assets/mountain.avif"
      media="(min-width: 700px)"
      type="image/avif"
    />
    <!-- Large screens: fallback JPEG (good compatibility, lossy compression) -->
    <source
      srcset="assets/mountain.jpeg"
      media="(min-width: 700px)"
      type="image/jpeg"
      alt="A large mountain for a large page"
    />
    <!-- Small screens: WebP (great compression, widely supported) if supported -->
    <source
      srcset="assets/mountain.webp"
      type="image/webp"
    />
    <!-- Fallback: PNG (lossless, larger size) -->
    <img
      src="assets/mountain.png"
      width="300"
      height="200"
      alt="A small mountain for a small page"
    />
  </picture>
